# Quake2 MOD

Sort of a left for dead mod. This mod focuses on some left for dead aspects such as waves spawning in none stop, a timer to see how long you survive, and with some left for dead weapons.  To run the game just skip the opening cutscene and go to multipler an start a deathmatch on the Edge map. Make sure to skip the cutscenes or else the game will load up the original game for some reason.
